Freshservice RAG Assistant

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer user queries about the Freshservice API documentation. The application combines a web-scraped knowledge base with a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide accurate and context-aware responses.

The primary objective is to showcase how an LLM can be "grounded" in specific, proprietary data, ensuring it answers questions based on a verifiable source of truth rather than its general training data.

Core Functionality
The system operates in three main phases:

1. Data Processing      
2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
3. User Interface
